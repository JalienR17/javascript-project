My project reimagines the entrance to the NASA website by transforming what was once a plain, uninspiring introduction
into an experience that marries cutting-edge technology with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The main page now features a
dynamically animated robot designed with a high-tech, futuristic aesthetic. This robot isn’t just a static graphic—it 
embodies an active, interactive presence that immediately grabs the visitor's attention, signaling that they’re about to
explore a digital environment that is both innovative and accessible.
At its core, the design strategy creates an ambiance where state-of-the-art visuals and friendly usability go hand in 
hand. The futuristic vibe comes through in every element: sleek lines, modern color gradients, and subtle lighting 
effects that hint at advanced technology and forward-thinking design. Yet, these technical flourishes are balanced with
a warm, engaging demeanor. The robot’s movements and interactive cues are not overly mechanical but are carefully 
crafted to feel almost personable, inviting users to navigate deeper into the site with a sense of
curiosity and comfort.
This redesign significantly shifts away from the old, static introduction by creating an immersive journey right from
the homepage. Instead of encountering a bland, conventional opening, users are greeted with an experience that feels 
alive and dynamic. The combination of high tech visual elements and human-friendly design considerations ultimately
enhances user engagement, making the transition through the NASA website not merely a click-through interaction but
an invitation into a visionary digital space.
There’s so much potential in a design that can evoke both awe and warmth. Exploring how interactive elements such as 
these can further encourage exploration or even personalize user journeys might be the next exciting step
in your project.

BELOW ARE THE REQUIREMENTS I WAS ASKED TO FULFILL ENJOY :) 



🌐 Frameworks & Intro to JS Project| Recreate Your Favorite Website Using Bootstrap and JavaScript
OVERVIEW: For this project, you’ll choose a website you admire and recreate a simplified version of it using Bootstrap.
After completing the website, you’ll move on to Part 2, where you’ll write JavaScript functions to simulate features 
you'd like to implement in the future - without integrating them into the site.
This project will help you practice Bootstrap layout and components, while also developing your JavaScript skills with 
variables, functions, arrays, and strings.
NOTE: You have creative freedom for this project! If you can't think of a website you admire, you may create your own
site, like a portfolio. You can integrate examples from other portfolios, without copying one website exactly.
Dribbble is a great site to look at for inspiration. 

INSTRUCTIONS: In VS Code, complete the following tasks in your .html and .css files.

Part 1: Bootstrap Website
Goal: Create a responsive and well-structured website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
Requirements:
Navigation Bar
Add a navbar with at least 3 links (e.g., Home, About, Contact).
Ensure the navbar is responsive across different screen sizes (consider using Bootstrap’s built-in responsiveness).
Home Page
Build a homepage that matches the feel of the website you’re emulating.
Include headings, images, and a hero section to introduce the site.
Form Section
Add a single form for user input.
Examples:
Contact form
Sign-up form
Booking form
Use at least two different input types (e.g., text, email, number, or date).
Table 
Include a table to display relevant information.
Examples:
Event schedule
Product comparison
Price list
3 Bootstrap Components 
Choose any three Bootstrap components that suit your website.
Examples:
Cards to display projects or products
Carousel to rotate images
Modals for pop-ups
Accordions for FAQs
Integrate the components effectively to enhance the design of your site.

Part 2: JavaScript Functions
Goal:
Write JavaScript functions in a separate .js file to simulate interactive features you might add to 
your site in the future. Focus on using variables, functions, arrays, and strings. Your functions do not need to be
connected to the website at this stage. 
Requirements:

Write 4-5 JavaScript Functions
Each function should simulate a real feature relevant to your website.
Submit the JavaScript File Separately:
Your JavaScript functions should align with the website you created.
Comment your code to explain what each function does.

Here are some examples to inspire your functions:

Form Validation:
function validateEmail(email) {
  return email.includes("@") && email.includes(".");
}
console.log(validateEmail("test@example.com")); // true

Random Project Picker:
const projects = ["Portfolio", "Blog", "Weather App"];

function getRandomProject() {
  const index = Math.floor(Math.random() * projects.length);
  return projects[index];
}
console.log(`Featured project: ${getRandomProject()}`);

Total Price Calculation:
const prices = [19.99, 29.99, 49.99];

function getTotalPrice() {
  return prices.reduce((total, price) => total + price, 0);
}
console.log(`Total price: $${getTotalPrice()}`);

Feedback Storage:
let feedback = [];

function addFeedback(message) {
  feedback.push(message);
  return feedback;
}
console.log(addFeedback("Great website!")); // ["Great website!"]

📤 Submission Guidelines:
Create a GitHub repository to host your project.
Add all your HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (optional), and JavaScript files to the repository.
Include a README.md file that provides:
A brief description of the website you emulated.
How you used Bootstrap components in your project.
A summary of each JavaScript function and how you would integrate it in the future.
Testing and Organization:
Verify that your navbar, form, and other components work correctly.
Ensure the project is organized with all necessary files included and properly named.
Ensure that your JavaScript file is clearly separated in the repository.
Submission:
Submit the GitHub repository link in Google Classroom.


💡 Tips for Success
Plan ahead: Choose a website with enough content to emulate but not too complex.
Test responsiveness: Ensure the layout works well on both mobile and desktop.
Think creatively: Use your JavaScript functions to explore new features that could enhance your site!
